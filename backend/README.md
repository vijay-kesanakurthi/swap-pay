# Swap-Pay Backend

> Split bills with friends in any token. Receive in your token of choice.

This a backend application that simplifies expense sharing. It allows users to create groups, log expenses, and settle up debts. What makes it unique is its integration with the Jupiter API, enabling users to pay their share of a bill using any Solana token, which is then automatically swapped to the bill creator's preferred token.


## üõ†Ô∏è How it works:
1.  One person creates a bill (e.g., rent for 180 USDC).
2.  Group members can see the expense.
3.  They can contribute their share using any Solana token they hold (like BONK, JUP, SOL, etc.).
4.  Each contribution is automatically swapped to the bill creator's preferred token (e.g., USDC) using the Jupiter API.
5.  The creator receives the payment in their chosen token, and the debt is marked as settled.

## ‚ú® Features

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Go, Gin-Gonic
- **ORM**: GORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (designed for Supabase)
- **Crypto Integration**: Jupiter API for token swaps on Solana

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go (version 1.18 or higher)
- A PostgreSQL database. You can get one from [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vijay-kesanakurthi/swap-pay
    cd swap-pay/backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your database connection string:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
    ```
    
4. **Create tables in database**
    Create the tables in Supabase using sql in `databases/sql`

5. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
